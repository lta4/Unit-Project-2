## Project Description
Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.
## API
For this project I plan to make a (random) detailed list of Star Wars characters. It will include both the good (light) and the bad (dark) in random orders. A card will show the characters details. A  navigation bar with forwarding links to certain areas in the site.

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min
The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  
#### MVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 
| Nav | H | 2.5hr | hr |
| Nav Links | H | 2.5hr | hr |

| Total | H | 15.5hrs| hrs |
## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.
Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 
| Component | Description | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| App {State} | Initial data/pull/ include React Router | H | 2.5hr | hr |
| Nav | This will render the header include the Nav | H | 2.5hr | hr |
| Home | This will render the Nav | H | 2.5hr | hr |
| About/Why? {Stateless} | This will render the Nav | H | 2hr | hr |
| Footer {Stateless} | This will render the Home | L | 2hr | hr |
